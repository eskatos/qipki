QiPKI
=====

QiPKI is a simple X.509 PKI implemented in Java using Qi4j.

Each component is built as a library and has a http service as restfull as possible using json format for data structures.

This is Work In Progress, don't expect something with easy setup and comprehensive documentation for now.
