    extendedKeyUsage : FUCK, need to find reliable info about this
        Two interpretations as to what extended key usage values mean when set in a CA certificate
            • Certificate can be used for the indicated usage
                – Interpretation used by PKIX, some vendors
            • Certificate can issue certificates with the given usage
                – Interpretation used by Netscape, Microsoft, other vendors
        As usual, PKI people are split 50:50 on this

    netscapeCertType
        Discontinued since 10 years ... is it needed ?

    privateKeyUsagePeriod
        Disallowed by the PKIX profile, although no-one can provide a reason for this

    nameConstraints
        On CA only
        Constrain the DN subtree under which a CA can issue certificates

        Name constraints can be avoided through creative name encoding (Problem in standards)
            • Multiple encodings for the same character, zero-width spaces, floating diacritics, etc
            • Can make identical-appearing strings compare as different strings
            • Can also evade name constraints by using altNames
